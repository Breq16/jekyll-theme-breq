# Breq's Awesome Jekyll Theme
**Hello!** This is my *theme* I'm working on for my [website](https://breq.dev/).

The intent is for me to use this one theme in all the projects I make which have websites. I run a lot of websites and microservices, and having a unified design language will help these services appear cohesive.

Here's an image:

And here's a table:

| Tool type | Materials required |
| --- | --- |
| Picaxe | 3 |
| Sword | 2 |
| Shovel | 1 |
| Axe | 3 |
| Hoe | 2 |

Wasn't that fun?
